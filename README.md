# Selfie Geolocator App

I tried to create an app that allows the user to take a selfie and store It to his local storage with the information on where he took the photo.

Also the user is able to download the photo to his device(pc or mobile).

Feel free to check the source code of this app here: https://github.com/Ierofantis/Selfie_geoloc

and the live demonstration here : https://selfiegeolocator.herokuapp.com/

(Try this app on mobile for better results)
